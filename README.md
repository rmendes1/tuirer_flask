# **Description**
_This is a fictional project and only for study purposes_

Tuirer is a website developed with Flask. It shows some basic functionalities, such as login/logout an account and store users data into a database.
As usual, this project has been done following the MVC workflow. All files and docs are organized in this way.

# **Tools**

For this project, Flask was used to hold the application backend.
  - Flask SQLAlchemy, Flask Script and Flask Migrate performed the SQLite database creation/migration/management;
  - Jinja2 lib helped the interconnection between Flask app and HTML archives;
  - Flask Login was used to construct the form page.

A Bootstrap template was used. This template can be found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/examples/jumbotron-narrow/

# **Pages**

## Home Page
Firstly, the user can have access to the page through its index, which is constructed to have this appearance

## Login Form
The user can put his/her credentials accessing the login page. A form will require a username, a password, and if the user wishes to have his credentials remembered.

After logging in, the application will send a confirmation.
